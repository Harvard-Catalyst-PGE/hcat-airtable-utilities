# Airtable Utilities for Harvard Catalyst Tools
Author: Matthew Thomas

This repository includes several utilities useful for developing Airtable apps
conforming to the Harvard Catalyst Tools backend.

As of the initial 0.1.0 release, this consists of a fetch() wrapper to make
API calls to the backend server. After feasibility is demonstrated and testing
package deployment to npm, this repository will feature more utilities to help
reduce code duplication and speed up development of Airtable apps.
